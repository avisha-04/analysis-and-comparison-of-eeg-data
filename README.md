# EEG Data Analysis
This was a undergraduateÂ project in which I learned about EEG data preprocessing and analysis. In addition, I performed an exploratory analysis comparing the performance of two EEG devices (EMOTIV and Cogwear) by analysing EEG recordings from six participants while playing the penalty shot game.

Here I have uploaded visualisation and analysis files of an example participant's EEG data from both devices.
